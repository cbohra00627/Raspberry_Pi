# Weather Station  
It is a Raspberry Pi based weather station. It shows the basic parameters of environment like the temperature (C), relative humidity (%), pressure (hPa) and light intensity (Lux). This project uses Pimoroni Enviro board for this purpose. It is basically designed for indoor monitoring. It has various onboard sensors:
1. BME280 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor
2. LTR559 light and proximity sensor
3. MEMS I2S digital microphone
4. 0.96'' color LCD (160x80)
